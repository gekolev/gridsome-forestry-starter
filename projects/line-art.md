Line work of images. A culture study. Most people will recognize them immediately. I wanted to convince myself how strong of an impact these images have played in the lives of people. How many times have they had to see them in order to be able to remember them so vividly and recognize them so fast. I threw in a few not so easily or at all recognizable images just to be sure that the people who I asked were not saying they had seen everything and recognized everything. Some are very famous people, some are album covers, some are scientists and others are just my friends.  
  
All of them are done in vector so they can be expanded or manipulated further. I would like to still try to make them animate or distort them somehow with some JavaScript code, but unfortunately I can not afford to spend time on them... maybe one day in the future...  
  
The impact that culture plays in our lives is massive. Cultural differences were very obvious from person to person depending on the background of the individual. This is the beauty of diversity at play.
