After doing extensive research of the artists from the creative brief I discovered the world of IDM (Intelligent Dance Music). Most of the visuals on the albums of the artists were inspired by the music, which made both cover and content very coherent and connected. In the poster design I wanted to represent the style of the whole music genre and the style of the artists.

  
I tried to build around something which was already there. The artists already had an existing style therefore I just needed to represent it as best as possible, not reinvent it. Most of their album covers feature simple text on a plain background, however one of them had a black and white picture of a piece of electronic equipment which was distorted and looked like it was melting. So I decided to ‘melt’ the lines and the focus point in the middle, which gave a whole new feel of movement to the piece. Shaping the visual hierarchy of the elements in the design felt tricky, depending on the center abstract shape. I settled for a more ‘calm’ shape in the center and then I managed to fit the artist’s names pretty high on the poster. However they didn’t POP enough therefore I thought I would play around with negative space in order to make it more visually attractive and interesting for the audience. I chose to have ‘the field’ in the middle because he’s the most well known of the artists.
