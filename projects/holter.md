Holter is a company which makes smartwatches. This project was very interesting because it helped me understand better luxury brands and packaging. The brand needed to feel luxurious and daring. The swiss feel of the whole box helps the product feel more premium and exclusive. Good spacing between different elements makes it seem like there are more visual components than there actually are.
