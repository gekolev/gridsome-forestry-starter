During my internship at  [Ny](https://ny.se "Ny") I learned a lot about 3D on the web. This is a little test page created entirely in three.js. It is build by 4 spinning cubes made out of different materials layered on top of each other and lit by two lighting sources. Experimenting with 3D on the web is extremely crazy and enjoyable, when it works.
