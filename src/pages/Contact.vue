        <h2>I'm a reasonable guy, interested in design and web technologies.</h2>
        <p>I am a highly creative and multitalented individual focusing on the fusion of classic design principles and technology. My interests include multimedia expression, marketing and front-end development. I believe visual communication is crucial to navigating in our chaotic reality. Teamwork, collaboration and interpersonal relations are vital to achieving any goal, therefore I have tried to advance my soft social skills as much as possible. I have done freelance projects in which these skills have proven to be essential. Working under high pressure situations has taught me to be more independent and flexible in my work.</p>
        <p>I have a passion for great design, of any kind. I love the extremes, either a clean, minimalist design where form follows function or a crazy brutalist page where you loose yourself amongst the horrible colours and images.</p>
        <p>In the past I have mostly worked as a graphic designer. I have experience in print, but the digital world offers so much more in terms of possibilities. Therefore, I am planning on focusing mostly on interaction and interface design in web environments. </p>
        <p>In the future I would like to learn as much as possible about interaction design and user experience. Animations, micro interactions and all other elements of interfaces are facinating to me and seem like a good starting point for my journey. Creative web development also seems like an amazing thing to learn. Static sites are very interesting, the performance is crazy and I don't really understand how they work so well. Maybe I'll need a mentor or someone to guide me in the start...</p>
