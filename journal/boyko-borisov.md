# Protests and civil unrest

In Bulgaria for weeks we have had anti corrpution protests and I wanted to try to go viral by editing a picture of one of our most controversial politicians. Boyko Borisov is our PM. 

The joke is that he has one ear and doesn't hear what the people are shouting and protesting about haha I know hilarious.
