# Stamps

Typo Collective had an idea to create our own custom post stamps, because we thought it would be fun and the post office workers would appreciate them.   
  
My stamps consisted of mostly symbols and silhouettes.

I created 12 stamps which I currently use to send letters to my friends with.
