# Classical animation style

Today on me torturing myself I present to you frame by frame animations. 

This is all done in Photoshop with the help of a plugin. It shows onion skins and makes it easier to animate frame by frame. Some shortcuts are different and easier with the plugin. It also allows you to control the timeline better. 

I can not take credit for the style of the tiger since I re-drew it from the original video. But holy smokes did it turn out cool. I would like to maybe draw more in the future and develop my own animation style, even if ugly.

I did not have the nerves to make a perfect loop for this jumping ball.
