# Creative New World Workshop

On the 11th of February **Apple** hosted an event with **It's Nice That** as a part of their _Creative New World_ project. The event was online and consisted of a short presentation and a workshop after, with a selected artist, on that day we worked with Konstantinos Trichas. A Greek designer currently based in New York with a lot of experience in graphic design and visual communication.

## Workshop

Our goal for this session was to create a few postcards in a triptych format.

They would contain a starting point describing our current location, an end point with a place would like to be and then the middle part of the triptych would be a way of getting there. The point was to create unique and personal postcards. We had very little time to handle this task. No more than 25 minutes.

After much blood, sweat and tears I came up with this.

## Discussion

After the workshop was over and everyone had stopped working on their pieces. The hosts asked us to upload them in order to show everyone what we had made and discuss what they might represent.

There were so many different people from all over the world submitting their work, I never thought mine would get picked amongst them. The hosts and Konstantinos started showing one by one some of the submitted works. Most of them were based in illustrations, which made me completely sure mine wouldn't be shown. I noticed that a lot of very talented French artists and designers were showcased in the final showdown.

I was fascinated by how much people were able to express trough their illustrations and drawings. Some where done in Procreate, some where done in Photoshop and one of my favorite ones was done on a piece of paper. Traditional mediums are rarely seen these days and you can really see the texture of the paper, the gentle strokes of the brushes and the little mistakes the designer had made.

## Final words

As we were approaching the end of the workshop I had already forgotten about my summation. However, as they were saying final closing words they showed a few more works and there it was... MY TRIPTYCH!
