# I got a job as a junior

I've been looking for a job and I finally landed an interview at a good company. I had a few interviews and meetings with the CEO and finally we both decided we would like to work with each other. It will be my first time working as a sandalone developer. I made a t-shirt to commemorate this moment.

I'll see if someone notices at work...

Really anticipating learning more about web technologies and meeting my colleagues.
