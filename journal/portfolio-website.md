# This is the website

I created this website with the help of Gridsome and a template there. It was my first time using Gridsome and Forestry. Gridsome is a static site generation compiler like Gatsby, but for Vue instead of React. 

Starting off I had no idea what I was doing. I had used Vue before for small University projects, but never on this scale. A portfolio website isn't usually a 'big scale' project, but all of the config files and setup was definitely scary.

Importing a third party library is really hard and confusing. I spammed the Gridsome Discord server for a few days with zero luck in getting any help. 

This static site got rated by Google's Lighthouse at **99%** both on desktop and on mobile. As a qualified nerd I would say yes, the preformance is worth the complicated process of creating the site.

Modules - Import - Export - Data objects - Node paths - Nightmares 

## Would I do it again?

YES.

Preformance wise it feels soooo goooooood. It would have been a lot easier just throwing in script tags and links into the header of a normal website, where you know that the script you placed and what it will do. I am limiting my capabilities in terms of technical execution which will ofcourse affect the interface and the design, in order to gain preformance. If I understood the process and framework better maybe I would free myself of these limitations, but until then I am stuck with an edited template, which I lowkey like. I know there's no home button, but shut up and use the logo ok/?
